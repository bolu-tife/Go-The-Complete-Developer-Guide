# Interface
An interface is a custom type that is used to specify a set of one or more method signatures and the interface is abstract, so you are not allowed to create an instance of the interface.

you can declare the function to expect

## Categories of Types
1. concrete types
    - something you can create a value out of
    - eg - int, string, map, struct and custom concrete types
2. interface type
    - cannot create a value out of it
    - eg interface

## Properties of Interfaces
- are not generic types; not as flexible as in other languages
- are implicit
- help to manage types
- are abstract

## Note
- they don't necessarily help in the correctness of the code
- they help in managing type implementations
